## About
The package provides the implementations of several smart-meter privacy algorithms and privacy measures.

## How to install

The recommended way of working with the package consists of the following steps:
- install [R](https://www.r-project.org/);
- install [RStudio](https://posit.co/);
- open `bpriv.Rproj`;
- open and execute `build.R` (`Ctrl+A` -> `Ctrl+Enter` in Rstudio). Answer 'Yes' if/when the installation of additional packages is proposed;
- if the installation breaks due to the absence of some packages `install.packages(<package_name>)` and execute `build.R` again.

After successful installation, in RStidio (by default bottom-right window, tab 'packages'), navigate to 'bpriv' to see the list of functions it contains. Click the function name to see its description and exemplary usage.
